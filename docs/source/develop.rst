Development
===========

Please refer to the style and contribution guidelines documented in the
`IRF Software Contribution Guide <https://danielk.developer.irf.se/software_contribution_guide/>`_.
Generally external code-contributions are made trough a "Fork-and-pull"
workflow, while internal contributions follow the branching strategy outlined
in the contribution guide.
