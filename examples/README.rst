TODO
----
Turn all these into proper examples of programmatic functionality as well as with cli-examples

Have an example on how to download data to test on

Use argparse on all examples to allow for pesonalized use of them, but provide a way for sphinx to compile the examples still, maybe include data fetching in the docs makefile?

make sure plot sizes are correct with figsize=()
